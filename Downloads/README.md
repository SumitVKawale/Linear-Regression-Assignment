## General Information
- A multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes
- Prediction for number of bikes rent for Boombikes
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
- Data set used is information of number of bikes rented based on various conditons like day, month, temperature, holiday.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Number of bikes rented in a day is highly based on number of users registered, casual users, bikes rented on Thursday, month and rain
- Most bikes are rented in month of September
- Fall is the best season for renting bike
- Most bikes are rented on Thursdays
